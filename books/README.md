His personal methodology for developing systems. Takes us through the complete process and covers all the critical parts of developing systems, which includes much more than the trading strategy. Has good advice on backtesting.

**Advances in Financial Machine Learning**, Marcos Lopez de Prado  
Whereas Davey's approach is small-scale, Prado writes about building larger-scale systems using big data, for example. But he covers essential areas of systems trading with a fresh and realistic perspective that will be useful, even to traders building smaller-scale systems. Includes a section on how to avoid pitfalls in backtesting.
